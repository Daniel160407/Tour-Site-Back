# Georgia & Tours

Description
-----------
This is my first real project's backend side. Here you can find the tour you want and order it. You can also connect to the Admin for more details.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- **Spring framework**: Powering the backend operations and business logic.
- **MySQL**: Storing tour information and user data.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**: Managing database interactions and entity mapping.
- **Flyway Database Manager**: Handling database migrations and version control.
- **WebSocket**: Enabling real-time communication for dynamic updates.

What I Learned
--------------
I used Spring framework for the first time, and it was a good experience. I learned how to transfer images through Jackson and byte codes.
